# hello-world

Hello to all who read this!

I'm Titus, welcome to my github account. I'm here on github as part of starting HarvardX CS50 on edx. I am really excited to start my learning of computers and computer science. I am a very inexperienced computer user with hopes to have at least a more fundamental understanding of computer learning and computer systems. Technology is so fascinating in its rapid development in recent history and I really just want to understand better, to hopefully help others as I have been helped so greatly by the development of technology and its ever more broad grasp on society.

Thanks for reading and learning more about me!

Titus
